## Overview

This repository contains 3 applications:  
* Web Application 
* UpdateDevices function app
* (WIP) InTuneEnrollment function app

These applications can be deployed into Azure App Services (Windows or Linux) or Container Instances via Azure CLI, Visual Studio, or GitHub Actions.

Software is currently built on .NET6 and function apps are using isolated worker model.

## Dependencies

### CosmosDB

The software utilizes a CosmosDB to maintain application data.  
* Database Name:  DelegationStationData 
* Container
  * Name: DeviceData  
  * PartitionKey: /PartitionKey

 *Note:  You can use a different different DB and Container name, but you will need to update related configuration values for each of the apps.*

### App Registration (Web Application)

From your AzureAD tenant in the Azure portal, add a new app registration.  
**Name**:  DelegationStation</br>
**Supported account types**:  Accounts in this organizational directory only</br>

#### Authentication Blade

Click on **+ Add a platform** and select **Web**</br>

Set the following settings and don't forget to hit **Save**

##### Redirect URI
Add a Redirect URI value to return to the application URL.
Example: https://delegationstation.azurewebsites.net/signin-oidc or https://delegationstation.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback

*Note:  The URL path (/signin-oidc) must match the CallbackPath setting in the Application.*

##### Implicit Grant and hybrid flows
Select **ID tokens** for the implicit grant and hybrid flows.

##### Supported account types
Select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**

#### API Permissions

##### For User Login

Ensure the following Permission is listed under Microsoft.Graph
- User.Read  (Delegated)

##### Graph Permissions

Click on **+ Add a permission** 
Select **Microsoft Graph** 
Select **Application permissions**

Add the following permissions:
- Device.ReadWrite.All   (Allows for updating of device attributes)
- Directory.Read.All     (Allows for listing of AD Groups)
- DeviceManagementManagedDevices.ReadAll (Allows for reading and updating devices)

Once done, ensure that you have been Granted Admin Consent for these permissions.

#### Certificates & Secrets

##### Certificate-based Authentication

This assumes you already have a certificate you will be using for authentication.  
You will need a .CER/.CRT/.PEM file with the public key for the App Registration.
But you will also need a PFX with the private key (and a set passphrase) to configure in the Application

- Click on **Certificates** 
- Click on **Upload Certificate**
- Select the file to upload from your local machine.
- If you do not enter a description, it will use the Subject which you will need to use in the Application Configuration settings.

##### Secret-based Authentication

- Click on **Client secrets**
- Click on **+ New client secret**
- Store the value in a secure location (key vault is recommended).  This will be used in the configuration of the application.  

#### Token Configuration
This application utilizes Entra ID groups for accessing the application through claims. Each group that is assigned a role must be configured to be sent as a claim from the enterprise application.
Add the following claims to the App registration:

1. Navigate to the Token configuration blade.
1. Click on **+ Add groups claim**
1. Select **Security groups** OR **Groups assigned to the application (recommended for large enterprise companies to avoid exceeding the limit on the number of groups a token can emit)**					
1. For each token type (ID, Access, SAML) select:
   - Group ID
   - Emit groups as role claims

#### Enterprise Application Setup

The Enterprise Application configuration will allow you to restrict designated users and groups to the application.

- From the AD tenant screen in the Azure Portal, select **Enterprise Applications**
- Click on the App Registration you just created.
- Click on **Users and groups**
- Add any groups or users who need access to the application.



### App Registration (UpdateDevices Function App)

From your AzureAD tenant in the Azure portal, add a new app registration.  
**Name**:  DelegationStationFunction</br>
**Supported account types**:  Accounts in this organizational directory only</br>

#### Graph Permissions

Click on **+ Add a permission** 
Select **Microsoft Graph** 
Select **Application permissions**

Add the following permissions:
- Device.ReadWrite.All   (Allows for updating of device attributes)
- Directory.Read.All     (Allows for listing of AD Groups)
- DeviceManagementManagedDevices.ReadAll (Allows for reading and updating devices)
- AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All (Allows for updating AUs)

Reduced permissions for monitoring without changes (will log changes, but not have permissions to apply them):
- Device.Read.All
- DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All

#### Certificates & Secrets

##### Certificate-based Authentication

This assumes you already have a certificate you will be using for authentication.  
You will need a .CER/.CRT/.PEM file with the public key for the App Registration.
But you will also need a PFX with the private key (and a set passphrase) to configure in the Application

- Click on **Certificates** 
- Click on **Upload Certificate**
- Select the file to upload from your local machine.
- If you do not enter a description, it will use the Subject which you will need to use in the Application Configuration settings.

##### Secret-based Authentication

- Click on **Client secrets**
- Click on **+ New client secret**
- Store the value in a secure location (key vault is recommended).  This will be used in the configuration of the application. 

### Azure AD Configuration

In order to limit the function app to only be able to update only relevant Security Groups, use one of the following two methods:
- Option 1:  Make the App Registration the owner of each of the groups the function app should have permissions to edit  
- Option 2:  Assign the App Registration a custom role on an AU containing all and only the relevant groups with the following permissions:
   - microsoft.directory/groups/members/read
   - microsoft.directory/groups.security/members/update

Any groups added to the application under Tags will have to have the service principals permissions added in order to work as expected.

Alternatively, you could add GroupMember.ReadWrite.All to the Graph Permissions granted to the App Registrations, but it is not recommended due to the broad access.

Do not make these changes if using reduced permissions to monitor changes but not apply them.


## Web Application Configuration

### Environment Variables
Use the following environment variables to configure the application. These can be set in the `appsettings.json` file or in the Azure App Service configuration.

Note that for nested settings, in the portal, the nesting is done via two underscore characters.  For example,
AzureAd__TenantId or AzureAD__ClientCertificates__CertificateDistinguishedName.

"AzureAd": {<br/>

### Certificate Configuration

This is only needed if you are connecting to Graph using certificates.

#### Local

- In Windows Explorer, go to the location of the PFX with the private key.
- Right-click on the file and choose 'Install PFX'
- Choose **Current User**
- Confirm the correct PFX file is listed and click **Next**
- Enter password for the private key and click **Next**
